# Music Player
## Description
The project I have developed is a music player that also functions as a dictaphone, as its name suggests. For the realization of this project, I have chosen the STM32F302R8T6 microcontroller. The user interface consists of an LCD display (LCD1602) and four normally open push buttons. The music files, which must be in .wav format, can be played from an SD card. It is important to note that the SD card needs to have a FAT32 file system, as I have used the FATFS middleware to communicate with FAT file systems in this project.
